Q-A-RAG-App-with-Gemma-and-Groq-API
The Gemma Model Document Q&A is a web application that allows users to ask questions based on the content of documents, specifically PDF files containing US Census data. Built with Streamlit and leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), this application utilizes embeddings and similarity search to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

Features :---
Upload and process PDF documents.
Ask questions related to the content of the documents.
Generate responses using the Gemma-7b-it language model.
Perform document similarity search to highlight relevant sections.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
Langchain: For handling document processing, embeddings, and language model interactions.
Google Generative AI: For generating document embeddings.
FAISS: For efficient similarity search in vector stores.
PyPDF2: For loading and processing PDF files.
dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.
